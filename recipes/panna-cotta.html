        <h3>Description</h3>
        A perfect dessert for romantic evenings or gatherings with friends!
        <p>If it's too sweet, try to add some lime juice and zest for a prickling new experience.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <strong>Panna Cotta</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>2 400ml cans coconut milk</li>
            <li>3 tbsp sugar</li>
            <li>1 tbsp agar agar powder</li>
            <li>1 vanilla bean</li>
        </ul>

        <strong>Raspberry Topping</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>125g raspberries, frozen</li>
            <li>2 tbsp sugar</li>
            <li>120 ml water</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Boil:</strong>Add coconut milk and sugar to a medium saucepan and set over medium/high heat. Bring to a boil (or at least 185°F, 85°C), then whisk in agar agar. Continue boiling for 3 minutes, watching to ensure it doesn't spill over.</li>
            <li><strong>Vanilla:</strong>Cut the vanilla bean in half lengthwise, and use the back of your knife to scrape out the seeds. Add the seeds to the mixture, whisking well to combine.</li>
            <li><strong>Cool:</strong>Pour mixture into 6 individual serving bowls or ramekins (you may choose to lightly grease them if you want to serve the panna cotta out of the bowls). Set in the fridge to cool until set, about 1 hour.</li>
            <li><strong>Topping:</strong>Meanwhile, add raspberries, sugar, lemon, and water to a medium saucepan. Cook, uncovered, over medium heat for 10 to 15 minutes, until raspberries have broken down and mixture has thickened some.</li>
            <li><strong>Serve:</strong>Optionally invert the panna cotta onto plates or serve in the bowls/ramekins. Top with raspberry topping.</li>
        </ol>
